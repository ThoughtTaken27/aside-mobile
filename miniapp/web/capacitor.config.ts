/**
 * Native Android shell for the Aside mobile app.
 *
 * The app is a remote client by nature: the agent, the browser, the
 * filesystem and the memory all live on the Mac, and the server that
 * fronts them is the only thing that can answer an API call. So the shell
 * loads the app from that server rather than bundling a copy.
 *
 * That choice is what keeps everything else simple. Because the WebView's
 * origin IS the server's origin, every relative `/api/...` path, the
 * session cookie, and the WebSocket upgrade all behave exactly as they do
 * in the browser. Bundling the assets locally would move the app to a
 * `capacitor://` origin and turn every one of those into a cross-origin
 * problem: CORS on every route, and a `SameSite=Lax` cookie that would
 * simply stop being sent.
 *
 * The cost is that the app needs the Mac reachable to paint at all, which
 * is already true of every screen in it.
 *
 * The hostname is a tailnet name, so it only resolves on the owner's own
 * devices. It is stable across reboots (Tailscale state persists) and
 * carries a real Let's Encrypt certificate, which is what lets the WebView
 * load it over https with no certificate exceptions.

/**
 * The Mac's tailnet hostname, e.g. `my-mac.tail1234.ts.net`.
 *
 * Read from the environment rather than written here because it differs
 * for every install, and a checked-in hostname would send someone else's
 * phone to a machine that is not theirs and cannot answer it.
 * `build-android.sh` fills this in by asking Tailscale directly.
 *
 * Failing loudly beats defaulting. A build that quietly produced an APK
 * pointing at the wrong host would only reveal itself as an app that hangs
 * on a blank screen, which is a much worse thing to debug than a build
 * that refuses to start.
