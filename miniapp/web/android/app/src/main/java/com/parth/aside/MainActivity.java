/**
 * The native shell.
 *
 * Its one job beyond hosting the WebView is telling the web app where the
 * system bars are.
 *
 * Since targetSdk 35 Android lays every app out edge to edge, so the
 * WebView occupies the whole screen including the strip behind the status
 * bar clock and battery. The web app already reserves space at the top,
 * but it read that measurement from Telegram's safe-area API, which does
 * not exist here, so it fell back to zero and drew its top bar underneath
 * the system icons.
 *
 * The CSS carries an `env(safe-area-inset-top)` fallback for this, and in a
 * recent WebView that alone is usually enough. It is not something to
 * depend on: WebView has historically reported those insets only for
 * display cutouts rather than for the status bar, and the behaviour varies
 * by Android version and OEM skin. Samsung's One UI is precisely the sort
 * of place that bites.
 *
 * So the real measurement is taken here, from the framework, and pushed
 * into the same CSS variables. An inline style set from JS outranks the
 * stylesheet rule, so when both paths work the native number wins and
 * nothing is padded twice.
