/**
 * Stamp the service worker's cache version with the identity of this build.
 *
 * `sw.js` used to carry a hand-written version string and a comment asking
 * the next person to remember to bump it. Forgetting costs more than it
 * sounds: the shell cache outlives the assets it points at, because a build
 * empties `dist` and emits new content hashes, so the cached shell asks for
 * an `/assets/index-<hash>.css` that is no longer on the server. The asset
 * handler misses, the fetch 404s, and the app paints with no stylesheet.
 * Both caches are behaving as designed, so nothing recovers on its own and
 * the phone stays broken until someone reinstalls it. Reproduced, then
 * fixed here.
 *
 * The id is a hash of the emitted asset filenames, which are themselves
 * content hashes. So it changes when and only when the bundle changes, and
 * a rebuild that produces identical output leaves everyone's cache alone.

/**
 * Emit `.br` and `.gz` next to every compressible build artefact.
 *
 * The server was shipping the bundle raw. Measured against the live
 * service on 2026-09-01: `/assets/index-<hash>.js` came back as 512KB with
 * `content-encoding: none`, and the whole emitted JS+CSS set is 1.99MB.
 * The same bytes gzip to 522KB and brotli to less again. On a phone
 * reaching the Mac over a tailnet, that difference IS the "everything
 * loads very slow" complaint -- it is several seconds of transfer on the
 * first launch of every new build, before a single byte can be parsed.
 *
 * Compressing at build time rather than per request is the right trade
 * here: these files are content-hashed and immutable, so the work is done
 * once instead of on every cold cache, and the server can hand the
 * precompressed file straight to the socket. `@fastify/static`'s
 * `preCompressed` option is what picks them up.
