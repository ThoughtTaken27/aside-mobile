/**
 * Service worker: installability, and nothing clever.
 *
 * A service worker is the one piece of this app that can break it in a way
 * a reload does not fix, because a bad cache entry outlives the page that
 * created it. So the rules here are deliberately narrow.
 *
 *   /assets/*  content-hashed by Vite, so a given URL's bytes never change.
 *              Safe to serve from cache first and keep forever.
 *   /icons/*   same idea, changes only when the file name does.
 *   /api, /ws  never touched. A cached API response is a wrong answer, and a
 *              stale session list is worse than a spinner.
 *   navigation network-first, cache as fallback, so a new build is picked up
 *              the moment the Mac is reachable and the shell still opens when
 *              it is not.
 *
 * The version string is the whole cache-busting story: bump it and every old
 * cache is dropped on activate.
 */
/*
 * v2: the search rewrite. v1 shipped a stylesheet with an unclosed rule
 * that silently voided every rule after it, and because `/assets/*` is
 * cache-first and never revalidated, a phone that fetched it once kept
 * rendering the broken build even after the server was fixed. Content
 * hashing does not save you here: it only helps if the HTML referencing
 * the new hash is itself fresh, and the shell falls back to cache the
 * moment the Mac is briefly unreachable. Deleting every non-matching
 * cache on activate is the only reliable way out of that state.
 */
/*
 * Stamped at build time by the `sw-build-id` plugin in vite.config.ts, from
 * a hash of the emitted asset filenames. It was a hand-written string with
 * a comment telling the next person to remember to bump it, which is the
 * kind of instruction that gets forgotten exactly once and then costs a
 * phone that renders unstyled until someone reinstalls the app.
 *
 * The failure it prevents, reproduced before this changed: a cached shell
 * outlives the assets it points at. `npm run build` empties dist and emits
 * new content hashes, so the old `/assets/index-<hash>.css` is gone from
 * the server. The shell in the cache still asks for it, the asset handler
 * misses, the fetch 404s, and the app paints with no stylesheet. Nothing
 * recovers from that on its own, because both caches are behaving exactly
 * as designed.
 *
 * Tying the version to the build means every deploy invalidates the shell,
 * so the shell and the assets can never disagree about which build it is.

/**
 * How long a cold start waits for the Mac before painting from cache.
 *
 * Straight network-first made every launch block on a round trip to the
 * Mac over the tailnet for the shell, and only then start fetching ~575 KB
 * of hashed assets. When the Mac is awake and nearby that is a couple of
 * hundred milliseconds; when it is waking, on another network, or the
 * tunnel is reconnecting, it is seconds of white screen.
 *
 * Straight cache-first fixes the stall and introduces a worse problem: a
 * shell cached from an older build points at older asset hashes, which are
 * themselves cached, so a new build would not appear until the second
 * launch. During active development that reads as "my change did not ship".
 *
 * Racing the two removes both failure modes. The network wins whenever it
 * is merely normal-slow, so the freshest build is what renders; the cache
 * only steps in when waiting would have been visible anyway, and the
 * network response still lands in the cache for next time.
