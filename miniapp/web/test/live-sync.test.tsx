/**
 * The three fixes behind "it never shows that it's actually working, and I
 * have to close the app and reopen the chat to see the latest progress".
 *
 * Each of these is a real bug that was reproduced against the live service,
 * and each one is invisible from a screenshot -- they only show up as a
 * thread that stopped moving. So they are pinned here rather than trusted.
 *
 *  1. A reconnect must tell the server to assume the client knows nothing.
 *     Without that flag the server rebuilds its baseline from the CURRENT
 *     file, so everything written during the outage sits on both sides of
 *     a diff and can never be sent. The thread stays frozen until the chat
 *     is closed and reopened, which is exactly what forces a REST reload.
 *
 *  2. A socket that is OPEN but silent must be replaced. Phones freeze a
 *     backgrounded socket without closing it, so `onclose` never fires and
 *     nothing ever reconnects.
 *
 *  3. A delta that starts past the end of what the client holds must not
 *     be applied. Splicing it on anyway welds two disjoint halves of the
 *     thread together, which is the duplicated / out-of-order card.
