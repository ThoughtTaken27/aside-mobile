/**
 * Running as an installed app instead of inside Telegram.

 * re-registers whenever the tunnel hostname rotates), and a place to live.
 * Installed to the home screen all three go away, and this module covers the
 * first one.
 *
 * The trade is deliberate. Telegram's initData is re-signed on every single
 * launch; a paired token is minted once and then sits in localStorage for
 * three months. That is only reasonable because the server is reachable over
 * a private tailnet rather than the open internet, so the token is a second
 * lock on a door that is already inside the house.

 *
 * Registration alone was not enough, and the failure is easy to miss from

 * and foregrounded for days. Nothing in that cycle re-fetches `/sw.js`, so
 * a rebuilt bundle sat on the server while the phone kept painting the
 * frame it had loaded hours earlier -- which reads exactly like "the fix
 * did not ship" even when the server is serving the new bytes.
 *
 * Two narrow additions close it:
 *
 *   - ask for an update when the app comes back to the foreground, which is
 *     the only reliable "the user is here again" signal a PWA gets, rate
 *     limited so a fast app-switch does not hammer the Mac;
 *   - reload once when a NEW worker takes control, because at that moment
 *     the old caches are already deleted and the page is holding markup and
 *     CSS from a build that no longer exists on the server.
 *
 * The reload is guarded on there having been a previous controller. On a
 * first install `controllerchange` fires too, and reloading there would
 * bounce the app on the very first launch for no reason.
