 * A modal panel that slides in from an edge, over a dimmed backdrop.
 *
 * Two edges, because Aside uses two: `bottom` for the transient sheets a
 * tap opens (a model list, a file, a set of sources), `right` for the
 * session sidebar. Both are dismissed by the backdrop and by Escape.
 *
 * The two sides get different headers on purpose, and it is not
 * inconsistency. A bottom sheet is a card you pull up and throw away, so
 * it takes the grab handle, the centred title and the drag -- and needs no
 * close button, because it has three better ways out. A right panel slides
 * from the side, cannot be flicked down, and keeps its `X`; giving it a
 * handle would promise a gesture that does not exist, which is worse than
 * the button it replaced.

   * Drag to dismiss.

   * over a sheet that cannot be dragged is the exact species of detail
   * that makes an app feel like a mock-up. So the gesture is real.
   *
   * It is armed on the HEAD only, never the body. A sheet's body scrolls,
   * and a drag that starts on a scrollable list has to guess whether the
   * user meant to pan the list or dismiss the sheet -- a guess that is
   * wrong often enough to make the list feel broken. The head is
   * unambiguous, which is most of why the handle sits up there.
