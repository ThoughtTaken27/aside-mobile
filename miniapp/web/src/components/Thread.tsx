/**
 * A thread, drawn the way the sidepanel draws one.
 *
 * User messages are light grey rounded bubbles. The assistant's answer is
 * plain markdown on the page background -- no bubble, no card, no avatar.
 *
 * Work is the interesting part. While a turn is running its steps are on
 * the page, live; the moment the final answer starts arriving they fold
 * into a single `Worked for …` row above it. `foldIsLive` below is that
 * rule: a running fold stays open until either the streamed answer has
 * begun or the transcript has already promoted an answer out of it. Mid-turn
 * commentary does not trigger it, because commentary is followed by more
 * tool calls, which clears the stream buffer and reopens the timeline.
 *
 * Two of these items never come from the transcript:
 *
 *  - a `pending` user bubble, appended the moment Send is tapped so the
 *    message is visible immediately, and dimmed until the transcript
 *    confirms it;
 *  - a `streaming` block, the answer as the CLI is writing it. It goes
 *    through the same markdown renderer as the finished answer so there is
 *    no reflow when the two swap.

/**
 * Whether the fold at `index` should still be showing its timeline.
 *
 * The rule, and the bug it replaces.
 *
 * The old rule was "live until any answer or streaming item follows". That
 * looks right and is not, because a `streaming` item is just whatever the
 * CLI has written to stdout -- and the agent narrates MID-TURN, between
 * tool calls, all the time. Every paragraph of commentary therefore
 * collapsed the timeline; the next tool call cleared the stream buffer and
 * re-opened it. On a chatty turn that is a fold flapping open and shut
 * several times a minute, which is exactly the reported "doesn't reliably
 * auto-expand, collapse is flaky".
 *
 * What actually distinguishes commentary from the final answer is whether
 * the agent is still doing anything. Commentary is followed by more work,
 * so a step in the block is still pending; the final answer only starts
 * once every step has its result. So:
 *
 *  - not running          -> not live (a finished turn opens collapsed)
 *  - a real `answer` item -> not live (the transcript has settled it)
 *  - streaming text while a step is still in flight -> LIVE (commentary)
 *  - streaming text with every step settled          -> not live (answer)
 *
 * Exported and tested directly; it is a state machine, not a detail.
