 * Tell iPhone owners to install the app, once.
 *
 * Chrome fires `beforeinstallprompt` and lets a site offer installation
 * with a button. Safari has never implemented it and shows no install
 * affordance of its own, so on iOS an uninstalled web app looks like a
 * website and stays one.
 *
 * That distinction is not cosmetic here. Running from the Home Screen is
 * what gets push notifications at all (WebKit gates the Push API on it),
 * and what exempts the app from the seven-day wipe Safari applies to
 * script-writable storage on sites it considers idle. Left in a tab, this
 * app would lose its saved session roughly weekly for no visible reason.
 *
 * Shown only where it is actionable: iOS, in a browser tab, not already
 * dismissed. Android is excluded because Chrome offers its own install
 * prompt, and a second one competing with it would be noise.
