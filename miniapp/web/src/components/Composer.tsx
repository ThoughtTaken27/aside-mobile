 *
 * Both carry the same model and effort pills, so the setting you can see
 * is always the setting the next turn will use, plus the `+` attach button
 * and the permission badge.

 * the extension rather than in the daemon -- the database only records the
 * tabs a session has already borrowed. There is no way to populate it

/**
 * The thread's bottom bar: permission on the left, model and effort on the
 * right, with the context-window ring between them.
 *
 * `permission` is the session's real mode, read from the daemon. A null
 * means we could not read it, and the label is omitted entirely -- showing
 * a plausible-looking default here would claim the agent is sandboxed when
 * it may not be, which is the one failure mode worth designing against.
 *
 * The label is now a control as well as a readout: tapping it opens the
 * same Permission popover the composer's badge does.
 *
 * The ring is NOT a spinner. Aside draws context-window occupancy here and
 * says so in its own tooltip; "the agent is working" lives in the streaming
 * footer above the composer instead.
