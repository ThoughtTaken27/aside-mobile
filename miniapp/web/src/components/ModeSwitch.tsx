/**
 * Chat or Web, at the top of the home screen.
 *
 * This started on the composer's control row, which was wrong for a reason
 * worth writing down: that row had exactly 94px of slack at 390px wide, and
 * a two-word segmented control wants ~88px of it. Everything still fit, and
 * the row went from comfortable to shoulder-to-shoulder, with the model
 * pill dropping to "Mo…". A control that only fits by consuming all the
 * breathing space does not fit.
 *
 * The top bar is the right home, and not only because there is room. This
 * switch changes what the middle of the screen *is* -- greeting and Recents
 * in one mode, suggestions in the other -- which is a screen-level change,
 * and a centred segmented control at the top is the established idiom for
 * exactly that. A control on the composer row reads as modifying the input,
 * which undersells it.
 *
 * It also costs nothing net: the top bar used to carry a magnifier whose
 * only job was travelling to the search page. There is no search page any
 * more, so that icon is replaced rather than joined, and the dead centre of
 * the bar finally does something.
 *
 * Reach is the fair objection, and the answer is that this is not the only
 * way in: a horizontal swipe across the composer flips the same bit without
 * leaving the thumb zone. Visible control for discovery, gesture for speed.
