 * mark, a greeting, and the composer -- and the history lives one swipe
 * below, scrolling up from under the composer.
 *
 * Nothing here is decorative-only. The greeting is the one place the app
 * addresses the owner by name, and it is also the thing that makes an
 * otherwise empty screen feel deliberate rather than unloaded.

 * The greetings, by hour band.

 * Six bands rather than the usual three because the edges are what matter
 * here: someone opening this at 01:00 and someone opening it at 09:00 are
 * not having the same day, and a flat "Good morning" for both reads as
 * generated.
 *
 * Several per band because there used to be exactly one, which meant every
 * launch inside the same stretch of hours produced a byte-identical
 * screen. A greeting that never varies stops being a greeting.
 *
 * `named` and `plain` are kept as separate strings rather than one
 * template with the name spliced out: dropping a name from
 * "Up late, %s?" by string surgery leaves a dangling comma, and every
 * near-miss there is visible on an otherwise empty screen.
