/**
 * Pairing an installed app that has no code in its URL.
 *
 * Every install needs this now: pairing codes are one-time and expire
 * after ten minutes, so there is nothing durable to bake into the APK.
 * Both platforms paste one fresh link from the Mac's pairing page into
 * this screen on first run.
 *
 * Tapping the QR link on the phone opens the tailnet URL *in Safari*, and
 * pairing there writes the session into Safari's storage. Adding the app
 * to the Home Screen then produces something with its own separate
 * storage, launched at the manifest's `start_url` with the `#pair=`
 * fragment stripped. So the new icon opens to an app that has never seen
 * a code, and cannot be handed one, because re-scanning the QR just opens
 * Safari again. Without this screen that is a dead end.
 *
 * Accepting the whole link rather than only the code is the point. The
 * realistic way this gets across is Universal Clipboard -- copy the link
 * on the Mac, paste on the phone -- and asking someone to first edit the
 * code out of a URL would be a poor reward for that.
