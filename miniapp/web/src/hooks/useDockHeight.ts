/**
 * Publish the docked composer's height as a CSS variable.
 *
 * The composer used to be a flex SIBLING of the scroller, which meant the
 * conversation ended exactly where the composer began and nothing ever
 * passed underneath it. That is why the dissolve had nothing to dissolve:
 * a blur over a strip of empty page is just a slightly different shade of
 * empty page. Claude's composer floats ON the transcript, with text
 * visibly continuing under its top edge, and that overlap is the entire
 * reason the effect reads as depth.
 *
 * So the scroller now extends underneath the dock (a negative bottom
 * margin) and pads its content by the same amount (so the last message
 * can still be scrolled clear of it). Both numbers have to be the dock's
 * REAL height, and that height changes constantly: the textarea grows with
 * the draft, the task list appears above it, a blocked-session banner
 * pushes it taller.
 *
 * Hence a ResizeObserver rather than a constant. A hardcoded 96px is right
 * exactly once, at rest, in one language, on one phone -- and wrong every
 * time the composer grows, in the direction that hides the last line of
 * the answer behind it.
 *
 * Writes to the HOST element rather than `:root` so two docks (thread and
 * home) cannot fight over one global value.
