/**
 * Citations, as Aside's transcripts carry them.
 *
 * Assistant text embeds `<citation refs="<id>[,<id>]">supporting text
 * </citation>`, sometimes with the supporting text wrapped in `<quote>`.
 * Rendered naively, the reader sees the raw tag -- which is exactly what
 * the mini app was doing.
 *
 * The transform here rewrites each tag into ordinary markdown plus a link
 * with a private `cite:` scheme, which the markdown renderer draws as a
 * tappable superscript chip. Doing it as a link rather than as a custom
 * remark plugin keeps inline formatting inside the quoted span working and
 * keeps this file testable on its own.
 *
 * Two rules that matter:
 *
 *  - A ref that resolves to no known source gets NO chip. Some models emit
 *    local markers (`refs="s1"`); a chip that opens an empty sheet is worse
 *    than plain prose.
 *  - A trailing, still-incomplete tag is dropped rather than shown. During
 *    streaming the buffer routinely ends mid-`<citation`, and flashing the
 *    raw markup for one frame is the bug this feature exists to fix.

 * The alternation matters, and so does the order of the branches:
 *
 *  1. A COMPLETE tag: `<citation refs="a,b">body</citation>`.
 *  2. An ORPHANED OPENING tag with no closer. Several models -- gpt-5.6
 *     among them, reproduced from a real thread on 2026-09-01 -- append
 *     the tag AFTER the sentence it supports and never close it. The old
 *     pattern required a closer, so none of these matched and the reader
 *     got a screenful of literal `<citation refs="NH9pusvrG-...">` in the
 *     middle of the prose. That is the "random citation refs that keep
 *     popping up" bug.
 *  3. An ORPHANED CLOSING tag, which is the same failure from the other
 *     end and is simply deleted.
 *
 * Complete tags are matched first so a well-formed pair is never split
 * into an orphaned open plus a stray close. Running all three in a single
 * `replace` keeps the chip numbering in document order, which a second
 * pass over the whole string would not.
 *
 * Attribute quoting is loose (double, single, or bare) because this is
 * model output, not a document format anyone validates.
