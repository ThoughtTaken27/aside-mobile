 *   {type:"error", reason}
 *
 * What changed in round 3, and why:
 *
 * Round 2 pushed raw transcript entries and the client answered each one by
 * refetching the whole structured thread through the CLI facade, throttled
 * to 1.2s. That is what made a reply appear in one lump -- nothing could be
 * drawn until a ~139MB binary had been spawned and had returned the entire
 * turn. Here the server builds the thread itself (a file read, no spawn)
 * and sends only the tail that changed, so a tool call shows up as it
 * happens rather than when the turn ends.
 *
 * Two levels of liveness ride on this socket:
 *
 *  - `thread_delta` is authoritative and comes from the transcript. Every
 *    completed part -- a text block, a tool call, a tool result -- lands
 *    within one watcher tick of being written.
 *  - `stream_delta` is provisional and comes from the running child's
 *    stdout, which mirrors the answer token by token well before the
 *    transcript line for that message is written. It is always superseded
 *    by the `thread_delta` that carries the real text.
 *
 * The per-connection baseline is reset on `turn_finished`, which forces one
 * full resync per turn. That closes the only gap in the diff scheme: a line
 * written between the client's REST load and this socket's first build
 * would otherwise never produce a delta, because the server's baseline
 * already contained it.
